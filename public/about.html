<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m an aspiring web developer with a background in supply chain management, 
  now transitioning into the world of coding. My journey into tech began with a fascination
  for how digital solutions can improve efficiency and simplify complex processes. 
  While I'm still relatively new to coding, my experience in supply chain has equipped me with a strong sense of organization,
  problem-solving skills, and attention to detail—qualities I now bring into my web development projects.</p>

<p>Sports have always been a big part of my life, teaching me values like discipline, perseverance, and teamwork.
  These qualities have become essential in my approach to learning web development,
  where every new challenge feels like an opportunity to grow. My love for sports
  also drives my commitment to stay determined and resilient, whether I’m troubleshooting
  code or mastering a new framework.</p>

<p>As a quick learner, I’m excited by how rapidly I’ve been able to pick up new coding skills
and apply them in practical ways. Each project I work on builds my confidence and knowledge,
bringing me closer to my goal of becoming a skilled developer. I’m eager to keep expanding
my abilities and connecting with others in the tech community who share a passion for building innovative digital solutions.</p>
